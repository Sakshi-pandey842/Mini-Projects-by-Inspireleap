# Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning mini-projects built using Python, Google colab Notebook, and popular data science libraries. Each project focuses on solving a classic prediction problem using supervised learning techniques.

## Projects Included

### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction

* **Dataset:** Titanic dataset (passenger details, demographics, and travel class)
* **Objective:** Predict whether a passenger survived or not based on input features.
* **Techniques Used:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests.
* **Skills Gained:** Data cleaning, feature engineering, classification modeling, model evaluation.

### 2. Diabetes Prediction

* **Dataset:** `diabetes.csv` (medical attributes such as glucose level, BMI, age, etc.)
* **Objective:** Predict whether a patient has diabetes based on health parameters.
* **Techniques Used:** Logistic Regression, SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors.
* **Skills Gained:** Data preprocessing, scaling, classification algorithms, accuracy comparison.

### 3. Sales/Advertising Prediction

* **Dataset:** `Advertising_Data.csv` (TV, radio, newspaper advertising spend)
* **Objective:** Predict sales based on advertising investment.
* **Techniques Used:** Linear Regression, Multiple Regression.
* **Skills Gained:** Regression modeling, correlation analysis, visualization of relationships.
